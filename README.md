### Requirements ##
* [Gatsby CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-cli)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

## Quick Start ##
Run the following in your terminal:

gatsby new my-map-app https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-starter-leaflet


## Starting from Scratch ##
* Set up Yarn: (https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)[https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/]
* Install the Gatsby CLI globally:

yarn global add gatsby-cli

* Inside the directory of your choice, scaffold a new Gatsby site:

gatsby new my-map-app https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-starter-leaflet

For example, if I want my installation in `~/Code/new-gatsby-site`, I would navigate to `~/Code` and run:

gatsby new new-gatsby-site https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-starter-leaflet

* Navigate to your new directory and run:

yarn develop

* You should now be running a new Gatsby site locally! ðŸŽ‰

## Inspiration ##
Our work began when we began building off of Colby's Fayock work (found here: https://github.com/colbyfayock/my-coronavirus-map ).
We worked on improving and displaying the COVID-19 statistics on the homepage of our website. It provides the following statistics:
* Confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
Along with this, information is updated in real time when the user accesses the page, thus ensuring users are receiving the most up-to-date information.

## Looking Ahead ##
This website serves as the building block to something more. We aim to continue building off this foundation to improve our website, whether it be allowing users to receive personalized information and so on.
With enough work, we hope to eventually build something compareable to John Hopkins own COVID map: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html
